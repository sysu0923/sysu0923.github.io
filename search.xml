In this article, we introduce the concept of regulatory RNAs (reg RNAs) and gather the current knowledge of the role of RNA molecules with regulatory functions (reg RNAs) in several pathophysiological pathways associated with heart failure, namely cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, regeneration, and angiogenesis.</p>

<h4 id="Short-non-coding-RNA"><a href="#Short-non-coding-RNA" class="headerlink" title="Short non-coding RNA"></a>Short non-coding RNA</h4><p>Composition: <strong>small interfering RNAs</strong>, <strong>piwi-interacting RNAs</strong>, and <strong>miRNAs.</strong></p>
<p>Origin: transcribed as long precursors in which miRNA-containing hairpins are cleaved by the sequential actions of the DROSHA-DGCR8 microprocessor in the nucleus and the DICER-TRBP complex in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Size: ~22nt</p>
<p>Function: binds to Argonaute proteins to form the <strong>RNA-induced silencing complex</strong>, which <strong>mediates target-gene silencing by mRNA degradation or translation inhibition</strong>.</p>
<p>Mechanism: MiRNA binding sites have been identified in <strong>3’ and 5’ untranslated regions</strong>, introns, as well as exonic regions of protein-coding mRNAs and lncRNAs.</p>
<p>Others: </p>
<ol>
<li>each miRNA can regulate hundreds of mRNAs, often targeting whole pathways.</li>
<li>miRNA families have identical <strong>seed sequences, likely sharing most targets</strong>. The result is a complex network that may be necessary to stabilize central pathways, often displaying high redundancy.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Long-non-coding-RNAs"><a href="#Long-non-coding-RNAs" class="headerlink" title="Long non-coding RNAs"></a>Long non-coding RNAs</h4><p>Characteristics: there are a few examples of lncRNAs displaying a conserved primary sequence, but <strong>conservation is generally weak</strong>. The <strong>secondary structure of lncRNAs is often conserved</strong>, suggesting that structural constraints may be more relevant than the nucleotide sequence in maintaining function. While <strong>many lncRNAs act in trans</strong>, leaving the site of transcription and executing various cellular processes throughout the cell, <strong>others work in cis</strong>, affecting nearby genes’ expression and chromatin state.</p>
<p>Function: </p>
<ol>
<li>Some cis-acting lncRNAs <strong>regulate the expression of neighboring genes by recruiting regulatory factors to the originating loci</strong>, thereby modulating their function. A prototype of this class of lncRNAs is represented by XIST (X-inactive specific transcript).</li>
<li>For other lncRNAs such as Airn or Blustr, <strong>the transcription or splicing of the lncRNA and not the transcript itself elicits the regulation of gene expression</strong>.</li>
<li>In other lncRNAs, such as lincRNA-p21, the <strong>functional elements are only the DNA sequences within the promoter</strong>, regardless of the encoded RNA or its generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>LncRNAs can <strong>bring together transcriptional repressors and activators</strong>, modulating the rates of RNA Polymerase II initiation and elongation, interacting with various complexes, such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 or 2.</li>
<li>Some nuclear lncRNAs have been implicated in <strong>maintaining nuclear bodies</strong>, such as atomic speckles, built on the architectural lncRNA, NEAT1.</li>
<li>Some <strong>antisense lncRNAs can base-pair with sense-mRNAs</strong>, altering splice-site recognition and spliceosome recruitment.</li>
<li>Other lncRNAs, such as MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), <strong>do not hybridize with the target mRNA but can affect mRNA splicing through cooperation with the splicing machinery</strong>.</li>
<li>Some lncRNAs <strong>act as a molecular scaffold, such as H19</strong>, which favors mRNA degradation mediated by the protein KSRP of myogenin.</li>
<li>Others <strong>bind their complementary sense transcripts and mask miRNA binding sites</strong>, such as BACE1 antisense that protects BACE1 from miR4R85-5p inhibition. </li>
<li>Several lncRNAs <strong>act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs),</strong> sponging miRNAs, and possibly other regulatory factors. For example, lincMD1 is encoded by the genomic locus containing the miR-206 and miR-133b and works as ceRNA for miR-133 and miR-135.</li>
<li>LncRNAs can also <strong>affect gene expression at the posttranslational level, inducing ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis</strong>. For example, HOTAIR, in addition to its epi-genetic function, can bind to E3 ubiquitin-ligases bearing RNA-binding domains, along with their respective ubiquitination substrates, facilitating their ubiquitination and degradation.</li>
<li>Cir-cRNAs, which are the product of back-splicing events and can accumulate at relatively high levels, act as ceRNA (miRNA sponges). They can also modulate RNA transcription, splicing, turnover, and translation and may have protein-coding potential.</li>

<li>These should be intended as operative categories, <strong>given that the distinction between coding and noncoding RNAs is sometimes blurred, with several cases of RNA species displaying dual roles encoding micro-proteins (less than 100 amino acids)</strong>. Accordingly, <strong>the genomewide analysis of heart translatomes, characterized using ribosome profiling, identified hundreds of microproteins expressed from both lncRNAs and circRNAs.</strong></li>
<li>Noncoding RNAs are <strong>classified for practical reasons according to their size</strong>, less or more than 200 nucleotides long, into short- and long-ncRNAs, respectively.</li>
<li>Regulatory RNAs can be subjected to <strong>methylation</strong>, the most important being <strong>N6-methyladenosine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>miRNAs targeting the five ′- the untranslated region can induce gene expression</strong>.</li>
<li>Though virtually all ncRNAs display at least one putative miRNA binding site, <strong>only a few are expressed at levels sufficiently high to operate as ceRNAs</strong>.</li>
<li>Circulating regRNA profiles have also been reported to <strong>change in response to environmental and lifestyle factors</strong>, such as exercise, diet, and circadian rhythm.</li>
<li>Common mechanisms of successful cardiac regeneration seen in lower vertebrates and neonatal mice <strong>include controlled inflammation and matrix remodeling centering around cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation</strong>. In contrast, new cardiomyocyte formation <strong>resulting from endogenous differentiation of progenitor cells after an injury</strong> has been questioned lately.</li>
<li><strong>Coronary vessel remodeling contributes to impaired myocardial contractility</strong>. In contrast, <strong>peripheral vascular remodeling results in decreased compliance</strong>, increased resistance, and reduced capacitance in the arterial circulation, thus increasing the afterload and exacerbating heart failure.</li>
<li><strong>Circular RNAs are expressed and regulated in the vascular system</strong>, although their role in heart failure development is still poorly known.</li>
<li><strong>Endothelial lncRNAs and circRNAs are regulated by hypoxia and may contribute to regulating fibrosis</strong>.</li>
<li>Given their <strong>relative cell-type specific expression and tight temporal and spatial regulation</strong>, regRNAs make attractive therapeutic targets and biomarkers for heart failure.</li>
<li>Intriguingly, most of the lncRNA studies described scaffold-based mechanisms (<strong>“sponge effect”</strong>), in which they prevent miRNAs from exerting their roles on mRNAs.</li>
